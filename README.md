My first repository is a blog post for ST558

Jasmine here, I recently traveled to state of Washington and discovered there are a lot of stand-alone drive-through coffee shops. They are all different merchants. I wonder what the coffee consumption is per person in that region. I also discovered a chain store only found in that area called Taco Time. Their tacos are far better than those from Taco Bell. Just my own taste thoughts. Their Walnut Shrimp Tacos are the best! However, not every Taco Time has it.
